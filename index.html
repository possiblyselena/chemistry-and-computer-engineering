            <p1>After high school, I plan to study computer engineering, which generally does not involve much chemistry (or so I thought). However in Grade 12 Chemistry, the unit that stood out to me the most the electrochemistry. I have designed plenty of PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) and used electronics in my everyday life. After learning about the redox table and galvanic cell, I have a better understanding why certain materials are used in computer components. After more research, I learned that computers and chemistry have more 'chemistry' than I thought!</p1>
